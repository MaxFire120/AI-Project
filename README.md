How Does Our AI Work?
    Our AI uses something called the Minimax algorithm to make smart moves. Instead of just picking random spots, it looks ahead at all the possible moves and chooses the best one to either win the game or block the player from winning.
    When the difficulty is set to Hard, the AI fully thinks through all the outcomes and makes the smartest move it can. On Medium, it sometimes plays smart and sometimes picks randomly to keep the game fun and a bit easier.
    As a group, we wanted the AI to feel challenging but fair, and using Minimax helped us add real decision-making to the game.
